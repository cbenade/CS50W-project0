# Project 0

## Summary
For Project 0, I have created a simple website meant to display and highlight some of the various coding projects
I have written over the last couple of months. 

At the top of my site a navbar has been placed to enable quick navigaton between pages 
allowing any visitor to easily move between different project scripts. 
On each page a simple project description is given along with any other additional information the viewer may need to know. 

Below are some brief explanations of each project file in this repository as per the project specifications: 
* [index.html](https://github.com/cbenade/CS50W-project0/blob/master/index.html): Home page for the Project 0 assignment. Gives user a brief explanation of the site and it's intended purpose
